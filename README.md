# Hemanth Hariharan

## Me, myself and I!

### Welcome welcome! I am Hemanth Hariharan, a second-year master's student in the [Sustainable Design and Construction](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc) program at Stanford University. I did my undergraduate studies in [Civil Engineering](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and am fascinated by the natural and man-made world. In addition to my passion for the sciences, I am a classical [Tabla player](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD-ADCjGbrHop9KUyhBZGA) (Indian percussion drummer) and an avid sportsperson!

## Projects
### [ERCOT Interconnection Queue Analytics](/Projects/Final_Presentation_ERCOT_Queue.pdf)
#### I analyzed and visualized trends in publicly available historical data from the ERCOT interconnection queue and used Machine Learning to predict study times and project outcomes. My research helps solar developers make more informed decisions on where to develop projects.

### [Low Carbon Fuel Standards - 24/7 carbon-free charging](/Projects/LCFS_24_7_project.pdf)
#### I conducted an independent study with my MS advisor, Prof. Rajagopal on decarbonizing Stanford University’s electric bus fleet. I Applied California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) to calculate potential monetary benefits for Stanford University through both charging and capacity pathways.
