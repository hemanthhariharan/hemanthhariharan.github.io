# Hemanth Hariharan

## Me, myself and I!

### Welcome welcome! I am Hemanth Hariharan, a second-year master's student in the [Sustainable Design and Construction](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc) program at Stanford University. I did my undergraduate studies in [Civil Engineering](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and am fascinated by the natural and man-made world. In addition to my passion for the sciences, I am a classical [Tabla player](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD-ADCjGbrHop9KUyhBZGA) (Indian percussion drummer) and an avid sportsperson!

## Projects
### [ERCOT Interconnection Queue Analytics](/Projects/Final_Presentation_ERCOT_Queue.pdf)
#### During my internship with Cypress Creek Renewables, I analyzed and visualized trends in publicly available historical data from the ERCOT interconnection queue and used Machine Learning to predict study times and project outcomes. My research helps solar developers make more informed decisions on where to greenfield projects.

### [Low Carbon Fuel Standards - 24/7 carbon-free charging](/Projects/LCFS_24_7_project.pdf)
#### I conducted an independent study with my MS advisor, Prof. Rajagopal on decarbonizing Stanford University’s electric bus fleet. I Applied California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) to calculate potential monetary benefits for Stanford University through both charging and capacity pathways.

### [Developing a roadmap for a 100% wind-water-solar (WWS) California](/Projects/100_WWS_CA_Report.pdf)
#### In Prof. Jacobson's course on 100% clean, renewable energy and storage for everything, I quantified end-use demand in California from EIA-published data and converted it to WWS energy to arrive at an energy mix containing rooftop and utility-scale solar, onshore and offshore wind, and existing geothermal and hydroelectric power. 

### [Financial modeling of HVDC undersea cable project](/Projects/Island_Energy_Project.pdf)
#### We worked on building a financial model of an HVDC cable project to utilize excess renewable energy capacity. We performed sensitivity analyses on construction timelines, exchange rate fluctuations, operating costs, and potential outages and made recommendations to improve project valuation.  

### [Net-zero energy home design in Wolfeboro, NH](/Projects/NZH_Project_Report.pdf)
#### As a team of two, we redesigned an existing summer home in Wolfeboro, NH to make it a NZE home using passive solar design strategies, rooftop solar, and a geothermal heat pump. An iterative process was employed to optimize the R-values of the building envelope and minimize shading losses. We achieved a projected NPV of savings of ~$30k over 20 years.
