# Hemanth Hariharan

## Me, myself and I!

### Welcome welcome! I am Hemanth Hariharan, a second-year master's student in the [Sustainable Design and Construction](https://cee.stanford.edu/academics-admission/graduate-degrees/ms-programs/sustainable-design-construction-sdc) program at Stanford University. I did my undergraduate studies in [Civil Engineering](https://civil.iitm.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, and am fascinated by the natural and man-made world. In addition to my passion for the sciences, I am a classical [Tabla player](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD-ADCjGbrHop9KUyhBZGA) (Indian percussion drum) and an avid sportsperson!
